# Evaluating Interactive Graphical Encodings for Data Visualization
User interfaces for data visualization often consist of two main components: control panels for user interaction and visual representation. A recent trend in visualization is directly embedding user interaction into the visual representations. For example, instead of using control panels to adjust visualization parameters, users can directly adjust basic graphical encodings (e.g., changing distances between points in a scatterplot) to perform similar parameterizations. However, enabling embedded interactions for data visualization requires a strong understanding of how user interactions influence the ability to accurately control and perceive graphical encodings. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of these graphical encodings when serving as the method for interaction. Our user study includes 12 interactive graphical encodings. We discuss the results in terms of task performance and interaction effectiveness metrics.

## Running the study
After downloading/cloning the repository, navigate to the code folder. Open the trialQuestions.html file in a browser to go through the trial questions participants were given. On completeing the 12 trial questions, you will be navigated to actualquestionsset.html automatically. This file has the code used to generate randomly ordered sets of 84 questions for each session. The responses to these questions were used for our analysis.

## Supplementary material
Under the supplementary_materials folder, you can find all the files used for the paper (images, tables etc.) and the analysis (interaction logs, line charts etc.)
